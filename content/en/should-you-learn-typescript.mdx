You can use it for both client-side and server-side development, and it can be used with any framework or library. Typescript is also a great choice for building large-scale applications, as it provides better performance and scalability compared to vanilla JavaScript.

One of the biggest mistakes I see new Typescript devs make is, they wanna migrate their apps written in Javascript to Typescript. This is a great idea, but it can be a daunting task. There are many challenges involved in the migration process, such as refactoring code, updating dependencies, and dealing with legacy code.
