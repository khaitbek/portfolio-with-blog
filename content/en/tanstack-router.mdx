**Typescript** has become a go-to solution for web development. It helps us write more reliable and efficient code. However, there were some places where we did not have the option to use **Typescript**. For example, let's say you want to create a **React** app. One of the first things you care about is **routing**. For **routing**, we almost had only one option: **React Router DOM**. However, **React Router DOM** is not type-safe. It is a great choice for **React** apps, but it is not the best choice for **Typescript** apps. You can use **React Router DOM** for a lot of your **React** apps, but if you're someone who loves type-safety like me, you might want to try **Tanstack Router**.

**Tanstack Router** is a type-safe routing solution for **React**. It provides a lot of benefits, such as:

- **100% inferred TypeScript support**
- **Typesafe navigation**
- **Nested Routing and layout routes**
- **Built-in Route Loaders w/ SWR Caching**
- **Designed for client-side data caches** (TanStack Query, SWR, etc.)
- **Automatic route prefetching**
- **Asynchronous route elements and error boundaries**
- **File-based Route Generation**
- **Typesafe JSON-first Search Params state management APIs**
- **Path and Search Parameter Schema Validation**
- **Search Param Navigation APIs**
- **Custom Search Param parser/serializer support**
- **Search param middleware**
- **Route matching/loading middleware**

As you can see in the image above, we have a `Link` component and we are passing down a `to` prop to it. When we used React Router DOM, we had to type the `to` prop as a string. But with **Tanstack Router**, you can get **autocomplete** for all the possible routes in your app. This is a huge time saver and makes your code more readable. If you didn't fully understand what I just said, take a look at the image below:

Let's see how you can start using **Tanstack Router** in your app. First, you need to install the package:

`pnpm install @tanstack/react-router@beta`

I use **pnpm** as my package manager, so I have to use `pnpm` to install the package. You can use **npm**, **yarn** or **bun** to install the package.

```

import { RootRoute, Route, Router } from "@tanstack/router"
import { RootLayout } from "./layouts"
import Home from "./pages/Home"
import Users from "./pages/Users"
import Posts from "./pages/Posts"

const indexRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/",
  component: Home,
})
const userRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/users",
  component: Users,
})
const postsRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/posts",
  component: Posts,
})

// create a route tree
const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([indexRoute, userRoute, postsRoute])

// create router
const router = new Router({ routeTree })

// register your router for type-safety magic
declare module "@tanstack/router" {
  interface Register {
  router: typeof router
  }
}

export default router
```

Here is what we need to do to get started with **Tanstack Router**:

- Creating a **root route** (ilovamizdagi barcha routelarni o’rab turuvchi route)
- Child **routes**. Ilovangizdagi sahifalarni birma-bir e’lon qilib ketaverasiz -
- Creating **route trees**
- Typescript magic:

```

declare module "@tanstack/router" {
interface Register {
  router: typeof router;
  }
}
{/* this is the code that we need to add to our app so that we can get Tanstack Router working properly with TypeScript */}

```

- Wrap our **App** component with the **RouterProvider**:

```

import { RouterProvider } from "@tanstack/router"
import router from "./router"

export default function App() {
  return (
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  )
}
```

- Now, let's create a **Navbar** component and add a **Link** component to it. The **Link** component is a built-in component in **Tanstack Router**. It is used to create links in your app. You can use the **Link** component to navigate to different routes in your app.

```
import { Link } from "@tanstack/router";
export function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/posts">Posts</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/users">Users</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

As you can see, with a small number of steps, we were able to get **Tanstack Router** up and running in our app. But, what we've talked about is just the basics. **Tanstack Router** has many more features and capabilities that we haven't discussed yet. In the future articles, we'll explore some of these features in more detail.

## Goodbye, React Router DOM?

I admit that **React Router DOM** is still a go-to solution in a lot of React apps, but I am sure that **Tanstack Router** will become the new standard in the future. If **React Router DOM** doesn't evolve well enough to compete with **Tanstack Router**, then **Tanstack Router** will easily take over.
